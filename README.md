# Kenya Crimes by County Dashboard

I have prepared this Power BI dashboard to visualize the crimes of Kenya by county and gain insights on which crimes are the highest and where, by counties of Kenya. This dashboard can help anybody who wants to gain a clear picture on Kenya crimes with respect to amount and location(by county).

## Data Used:
I used the data from the [Kenya Police website](https://www.nationalpolice.go.ke/crime-statistics). I used crime data from 2015 to 2021 which was the last year available. The data was obtained from PDF files which had to go through some cleaning with Python so as to be converted to csv files for easier visualization on Power BI. 
The data is also attached in the crimereportspdf root of the project directory.

Below is a link for the dashboard published in to my online Power BI account.
